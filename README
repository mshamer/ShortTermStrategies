The zipfile for reproducing Figure 1 includes three files:
(1) SJV.CWV.CM.hdist.Regress.rds - dataset used to produce the plot
(2) PM2.5.Site.Daily.Plot.R - R function for plotting
(3) PM2.5.Site.Daily.Plot_Example.R - code for execting the plotting function

The resulted plot demonstrates how many MAIAC AOD - EPA PM2.5 collocations are available during winter 2012-2013 over Central Valley, CA
(i.e. available MAIAC data over PM site locations, when PM data is available within +/- 1 hour around the satellite overpass time). 
The collocations are plotted as a time series (x-axis) by EPA PM2.5 sites (y-axis) over the whole study period. 
In addition to data availability this plot illustrates the variability of the data in time and in space.
