The zipfile for running a Random Forest (RF) model includes four files:

(1) TestData_RF.rds - example dataset used to run the model and the plot
(2) nrmse_func.R - R function to be sourced in the model for calculating Normalized RMSE
(3) plot_importance.R - R function to be sourced in the model for ploting variable importance
(4) RF-example.R - code for executing the model

The resulting plots demonstrate (1) the importance of the explanatory variables and (2) the association between  AOD - and the predicted PM2.5 concentratrions based on a RF model.
